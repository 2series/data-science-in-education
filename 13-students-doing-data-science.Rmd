Most of this book is focused on the practice of data science, or doing data science, in educational settings. 

There is an increasing interest on the part of many in the wider data science community on teaching and learning data science. For example:

* The R Studio conference calling for proposals on teaching
* Leek and co.'s work
* R Studio interns doing cool educational work, i.e., using Scratch with R studio
* R Studio's education team (there are some good presentations to cite)
* McNamara's work on the principles of good data analysis tools for learning

In addition to this wider work, there is work in educational settings, of course, on teaching and learning data science, too:

* Data science in education conference in 2016 at UCB 
* Harvard group 
* Courses at UCLA/UO/UVA
* Learning analytics work/educational data mining work
* This book!

In this chapter, we aim to turn, a bit, from doing data science, to learning it. First, we focus on the principles that helped us to write this text. 

## The pedagogical principles this book is based upon

This book is based upon pedagogical principles:

<!-- DO WE INCLUDE THESE AT THE BEGINNING/IN A PROLOGUE? -->

A key feature of this book is the pedagogical framework that guides it. As a book on data science in education, we take seriously how the book - itself - will be educative for readers. Our pedagogical framework, then, influences the planning and writing of the book. It consists of three principles: problem-based learning, differentiation, and universal design. We consider each of these in turn.

* Problem-based learning (PBL) is a method of instruction that presents learners with a real-world challenge in which they must apply their skills and knowledge to solve. This is critical because we, as authors, do not have all of the right answers in this text: there is not one right statistical model or algorithm, a technique to write code or even software and tools to utilize. Thus, the text features continuing challenges in the form of the five walkthroughs that reflect the types of challenges that educational data scientists may encounter in the course of their work. At the end of each tutorial, there exist exercises that provide the opportunity for readers to extend and apply the ideas presented in the chapter. Moreover, the challenges are structured in such a way that readers return to some of them, but with different aims, over the course of the book.

* Differentiation is a method for providing multiple pathways for learners to engage with, understand, and ultimately apply new content and new skills. We consider inclusivity (in terms of who belongs as a part of the audience for this text and how this broader view of who participates in data science implies the types of challenges, topics, and data that we include in the book) and accessibility (technically, in terms of how a wide audience of readers is able to access and use the book, as well as in terms of the ways in which the content is written based on the unique assets that those in education bring) along with how we differentiate the book. We differentiate the book by recognizing and providing background content/skills (either explicitly or through reference to other resources), embedded checks for understanding, and recommendations for where to begin based upon prior expertise. We also provide links to videos of coding and screenshots that are annotated and reflective of the content in the text to help to show readers how they are able to use what they are reading about.

 * Universal Design is a series of principles which guide the creation of spaces that are inclusive and accessible to individuals from all walks of life regardless of age, size, ability, or disability. While traditionally applied to physical spaces, we have extended these principles to the creation of a data science text in such a way that the text and accompanying materials will be designed for individuals from all walks of life, regardless of educational level, background, ability, or disability. Many of the seven guiding principles of Universal Design are readily transferable to the creation of a text, such as equitable use, flexibility in use (aided in large part through differentiation), simple and intuitive use, perceptible information, and tolerance for error.

## Different contexts for teaching and learning data science

<!-- Maybe discuss affordances and constraints of each of these -->

* On your own
* In a degree program or course
* Through a workshop
* At your workplace

## Teaching at the K-12 level

In addition to adults teaching and learning data science, there is increased attention on how to set the stage for adults to learn and do data science by teaching it at the K-12 level.
