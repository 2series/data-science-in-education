# Potential data sources

## Types of data

### Large, Nationally-representative data sets

* [PISA data](https://github.com/jrosen48/pisaUSA15)
* [NAEP](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/)

### Synthetic data sets?

* Via [synthpop](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/synthpop/index.html)
* Via [simstudy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simstudy/index.html)

## Ideas for other data sources

* Anonymized data sets from our own work?
