This is a place where we can collaborate on an outline and share ideas about the content of the book. 

# Unique Challenges of Doing Data Science in Education 
 - Combining content knowledge, programming, and statistics to solve problems is a fairly new idea
 - Some datasets are public as required by law. Others contained personally identifiable information
 - There are often no procedures in place for school districts to share data with each other in order to build context
 
# Solutions for the Adoption of Data Science Techniques 
 - The role of listening to clarify meaningful problems that parents, teachers, and administration want to make progress on 
 - Making new datasets by combining student level data with other datasets, like testing, wellness surveys, and transportation data 
 - Developing agreements across organizations for sharing and moving data 
 - Connecting data science tools (Example: R) to tools that teachers are comfortable with (example: Excel) 
 - Building pretend datasets to code against so that projects can be open source 
 - What is an ideal multi-disciplinary analytics team for school districts?
