# THOUGHTS
What are we uniquely positioned to provide guidance and insights on, and what is 
best outsourced to an additional resource?   

What does the reader know?  

* No - some - extensive background in education (all sectors)
* No - some - a lot - highly adept at R
* No - some - a lot - highly adept in another statistical language//software  
* No - some - a lot - highly adept at Excel 
* No - some - a lot - highly adept in statistics  

## For separate chapter

* Installing R//RStudio
* Environment//pane layout
* Customizing IDE//environment
* Help documentation
* When you come across something new//unfamiliar

## Focus content:

* Tibbles and dataframes (and matrices and vectors, oh my!)
* The tidyverse
* A reproducible analytical workflow (Projects, here(), DS cycle)
* Tidy data (what you have vs. what you want)

## Focus skills:

What if we touch on the basics and reference out to strong resouces, but then 
provide robust walk-throughs//exercises//explanations for concepts that _aren't_ 
well-explained elsewhere (and also teach in the context of education).

* Basic data frame exploration
* Build own data frame exercise?
* Writing functions - can we jump right into this, and use it as an example to 
explain everything else?
* Graphing
