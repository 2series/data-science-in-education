Doing data science in education is promising and challenging. This presentation reports on efforts to expand access to data science through the collaborative authoring of a book about data science in education. This book aims to explore and provide a *language* for data science in the education setting. Contributors to the book---most of which have never met in person---work together to describe these unique challenges by using tools like R Markdown, Bookdown, git and Github. We show how writing the book in the open empowers individuals from a myriad of roles in education (i.e., administrators, data analysts, teachers, and researchers) to contribute and improve the product. Contributors draw from their experiences in K-12 and higher education contexts to bring definition to data science in the education setting, where some of the features of data science are not yet accepted. These experiences include developing the role of data across organizations and finding solutions for working with confidential datasets. Lastly, the authors discuss how the growth of data science in education can be an example for other professions that are beginning to explore data science.
