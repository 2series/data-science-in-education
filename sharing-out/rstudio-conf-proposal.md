Doing data science in education is promising and challenging. This presentation reports on efforts to expand access to data science through the collaborative authoring of a book about data science in education and a language for data science in this context. The roles of R Markdown and Bookdown and git/Github to support individuals who have never met in person to work together are described through examples of how dilemmas were addressed. We show how writing the book in the open made possible the contributions of individuals from a myriad of roles in education (i.e., administrators, data analysts, teachers, and researchers) and improved the product. Challenges and opportunities from working to develop a language for data science in a profession in which some of the features of data science are not yet accepted are described through the authors' teaching, administrative, and research-related experiences in K-12 and higher education contexts and emphasize strategies to expand the role of data and data science across organizations. Implications and opportunities for other professions in which interest in data science is growing are discussed.
