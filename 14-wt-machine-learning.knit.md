## Introduction

### Background

One area of interest is the delivery of online instruction, which is becoming more prevalent: in 2007, over 3.9 million U.S. students were enrolled one or more online courses [@allen2008]. With the dawn of online learning comes an abundance of new educational tools to facilitate that learning. Indeed, online learning interfaces are used to facilitate the submission of assignments and quizzes in courses in which students and instructor meet face-to-face, but these interfaces are also used in fully online courses to deliver all instruction and assessment. 

In a face-to-face classroom, an educator might count on behavioral cues to help them effectively deliver instruction. However, one constraint of online education is that educators do not have access as readily to the behavioral cues that can be essential to effective face-to-face instruction. For example, in a face-to-face classroom, cues such as a student missing class repeatedly or many students seeming distracted during a lecture can trigger a shift in the delivery of instruction. While technology is rapidly developing, many educators find themselves looking for ways to understand and support students online in the same way that face-to-face instructors would. Educational technology affords unique opportunities to support student success online because it provides new methods of collecting and storing data. 

Indeed, online learning management systems often automatically track several types of student interactions with the system and feed that data back to the course instructor. For example, an instructor might be able to quickly see how many students logged into their course on a certain day, or they might see how long students engaged with a posted video before pausing it or logging out. The collection of this data is met with mixed reactions from educators. Some are concerned that data collection in this manner is intrusive, but others see a new opportunity to support students in online contexts in new ways. As long as data are collected and utilized responsibly, data collection can support student success.

One meaningful perspective from which to consider students' engagement with online courses is related to their motivation to achieve. More specifically, it is important to consider how and why students are engaging with the course. Considering the psychological mechanisms behind achievement is valuable because doing so may help to identify meaningful points of intervention for educators and for researchers and administrators in online *and* face-to-face courses interested in the intersection between behavioral trace measures and students' motivational and emotional experiences in such courses.

In this walkthrough, we examine the educational experiences of students in online science courses at a virtual middle school in order to characterize their motivation to achieve and their tangible engagement with the course in terms of behavioral trace measures. To do so, we use a robust data set, which includes self-reported motivation as well as behavioral trace data collected from a learning management system (LMS) to identify predictors of final course grade. Our work examines the idea of educational success in terms of student interactions with an online science course.

We explore the following four questions:

1. Is motivation more predictive of course grades as compared to other online indicators of engagement?
2. Which types of motivation are most predictive of achievement?
3. Which types of trace measures are most predictive of achievement?
4. How does a random forest compare to a simple linear model (regression)?

### Data Sources

This dataset came from 499 students enrolled in online middle school science courses in 2015-2016. The data were originally collected for use as a part of a research study, though the findings have not been published anywhere yet.

The setting of this study was a public provider of individual online courses in a Midwestern state. In particular, the context was two semesters (Fall and Spring) of offerings of five online science courses (Anatomy & Physiology, Forensic Science, Oceanography, Physics, and Biology), with a total of 36 classes. 

Specific information in the dataset included:

- a pre-course survey students completed about their self-reported motivation in science â€” in particular, their perceived competence, utility value, and interest
- the time students spent on the course (obtained from the learning management system (LMS), Blackboard
- students' final course grades 
- students' involvement in discussion forums

For discussion board responses, we were interested in calculating the number of posts per student and understanding the emotional tone of the discussion board posts. We used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; Pennebaker, Boyd, Jordan, & Blackburn, 2015) tool to calculate the number of posts per student and to categorize the emotional tone (positive or negative) and topics of those posts. Those linguistic categorization was conducted after the data was gathered from the discussion posts, but is not replicated here to protect the privacy of the students' posts. Instead, we present the already-categorized discussion board data, in its ready-to-use format. Thus, in the dataset used in this walkthrough, we will see pre-created variables for the mean levels of students' cognitive processing, positive emotions, negative emotions, and social-related discourse.

At the beginning of the semester, students were asked to complete the pre-course survey about their perceived competence, utility value, and interest. At the end of the semester, the time students spent on the course, their final course grades, and the contents of the discussion forums were collected.

In this walkthrough, we used the R package {caret} to carry out the analyses.

### Methods

#### Defining a research question

When you begin a new project, there are often many approaches to analyzing data and answering questions you might have about it. Some projects have a clearly defined scope and question to answer. This type of project is characterized by 1) a defined number of variables (data inputs) and 2) specific directional hypotheses. For example, if we are studying the effect of drinking coffee after dinner on ability to quickly fall asleep, we might have a very specific directional hypothesis: we expect that drinking coffee after dinner would decrease the ability to fall asleep quickly. In this case, we might collect data by having some people drink coffee and having other people drink nothing or an herbal tea before bed. We could monitor how quickly people from each group fall asleep. Since we collected data from two clearly defined groups, we can then do a statistical analysis that compares the amount of time it takes to fall asleep for each group. One option would be a test called a t-test, which we could use to see if there is a significant difference in the average amount of minutes to fall asleep for the group. This approach works very well in controlled experimental situations, especially when we can change only one thing at a time (in our coffee example, the only thing we changed was the coffee-drinking behavior of our participants - all other life conditions were held equal for both groups). Rarely are educational data projects as clear-cut and simple.

For this walkthrough, we have many sources of data - survey data, learning management system data, discussion forum data, and academic achievement data as measured by final course grades. Luckily, having too much data is what we call a "good problem." In our coffee example above, we had one really specific idea that we wanted to investigate - does coffee affect time taken to fall asleep? In this walkthrough we have many ideas we are curious to explore: the relationships among motivation, engagement in the course (discussion boards, time spent online in the course site), and academic achievement. If we wanted to tackle a simpler problem, we could choose just one of these relationships. For example, we could measure whether students with high motivation earn higher grades than students with low motivation. However, we are being a bit more ambitious than that here - we are interested in understanding the complex relationships among the different types of motivation. Rather than simply exploring whether A affects B, we are interested in the nuances: we suspect that *many* factors affect B, and we would like to see which of those factors has most relative importance. To explore this idea, we will use a machine learning approach.

#### Predictive analytics and machine learning

A buzzword in education software spheres these days is "predictive analytics." Administrators and educators alike are interested in applying the methods long utilized by marketers and other business professionals to try to determine what a person will want, need, or do next. "Predictive analytics" is a blanket term that can be used to describe any statistical approach that yields a prediction. We could ask a predictive model: "What is the likelihood that my cat will sit on my keyboard today?" and, given enough past information about your cat's computer-sitting behavior, the model could give you a probability of that computer-sitting happening today. Under the hood, some predictive models are not very complex. If we have an outcome with two possibilities, a logistic regression model could be fit to the data in order to help us answer the cat-keyboard question. In this chapter, we'll compare a machine learning model to another type of regression: multiple regression. We want to make sure to fit the simplest model as possible to our data. After all, the effectiveness in predicting the outcome is really the most important thing: not the fanciness of the model.
    
Data collection is an essential first step in any type of machine learning or predictive analytics. It is important to note here that machine learning only works effectively when (1) a person selects variables to include in the model that are anticipated to be related to the outcome and (2) a person correctly interprets the model's findings. There is an adage that goes, "garbage in, garbage out." This holds true here: if we do not feel confident that the data we collected are accurate, no matter what model we build, we will not be able to be confident in our conclusions. To collect good data, we must first clarify what it is that we want to know (i.e., what question are we really asking?) and what information we would need in order to effectively answer that question. Sometimes, people approach analysis from the opposite direction - they might look at the data they have and ask what questions could be answered based on that data. That approach is okay - as long as you are willing to acknowledge that sometimes the pre-existing dataset may *not* contain all the information you need, and you might need to go out and find additional information to add to your dataset to truly answer your question.
    
When people talk about "machine learning," you might get the image in your head of a desktop computer learning how to spell. You might picture your favorite social media site showing you advertisements that are just a little too accurate. At its core, what machine learning really is is the process of "showing" your statistical model only some of the data at once, and training the model to predict accurately on that training dataset (this is the "learning" part of machine learning). Then, the model as developed on the training data is shown new data - data you had all along, but hid from your computer initially - and you see how well the model that you developed on the training data performs on this new testing data. Eventually, you might use the model on entirely new data.  

## Random forests

For our analyses, we used Random Forest modeling [@breiman2001]. Random forest is an extension of decision tree modeling, whereby a collection of decision trees are simultaneously "grown" and are evaluated based on out-of-sample predictive accuracy [@breiman2001].  Random forest is random in two main ways: first, each tree is only allowed to "see" and split on a limited number of predictors instead of all the predictors in the parameter space; second, a random subsample of the data is used to grow each individual tree, such that no individual case is weighted too heavily in the final prediction. 

One thing about random forest that makes it quite different from other types of analysis we might do is that here, we are giving the computer a large amount of information and asking it to find connections that might not be immediately visible to the naked human eye. This is great for a couple of reasons. First, while humans are immensely creative and clever, we are not immune to biases. If we are exploring a dataset, we usually come in with some predetermined notions about what we think is true, and we might (consciously or unconsciously) seek evidence that supports the hypothesis we privately hold. By setting the computer loose on some data, we can learn that there are connections between areas that we did not expect. We must also be ready for our hypotheses to not be supported! Random forest is particularly well-suited to the research questions explored here because we do not have specific directional hypotheses. Machine learning researchers talk about this as "exploring the parameter space" - we want to see what connections exist, and we acknowledge that we might not be able to accurately predict all the possible connections. Indeed, we expect - and hope - that we will find surprising connections. 

Whereas some machine learning approaches (e.g., boosted trees) would utilize an iterative model-building approach, random forest estimates all the decision trees at once. In this way, each tree is independent of every other tree. Thus, the random forest algorithm provides a robust regression approach that is distinct from other modeling approaches. The final random forest model aggregates the findings across all the separate trees in the forest in order to offer a collection of "most important" variables as well as a percent variance explained for the final model.

500 trees were grown as part of our random forest. We partitioned the data before conducting the main analysis so that neither the training nor the testing data set would be disproportionately representative of high-achieving or low-achieving students. The training data set consisted of 80% of the original data (*n* = 400 cases), whereas the testing data set consisted of 20% of the original data (*n* = 99 cases). We built our random forest model on the training data set, and then evaluated the model on the testing data set. Three variables were tried at each node.

Note that the random forest algorithm does not accept cases with missing data, and so we deleted cases listwise if data were missing. This decision eliminated 51 cases from our original data set, to bring us to our final sample size of 499 unique students. If you have a very small dataset with a lot of missing data, the random forest approach may not be well suited for your goals â€“ you might consider a linear regression instead. 

A random forest is well suited to the research questions that we had here because it allows for nonlinear modeling. We hypothesized complex relationships between students' motivation, their engagement with the online courses, and their achievement. For this reason, a traditional regressive or structural equation model would have been insufficient to model the parameter space we were interesting in modeling. Our random forest model had one outcome and eleven predictors. 

One term you will hear used in machine learning is "tuning parameter." People often think of tuning parameters as knobs or dials on a radio: they are features of the model that can be adjusted to get the clearest signal. A common tuning parameter for machine learning models is the number of variables considered at each split [@kuhn2008]; we considered three variables at each split for this analysis.  

The outcome was the final course grade that the student earned. The predictor variables included motivation variables (interest value, utility value, and science perceived competence) and trace variables (the amount of time spent in the course, the course name, the number of discussion board posts over the course of the semester, the mean level of cognitive processing evident in discussion board posts, the positive emotions evident in discussion board posts, the negative emotions evident in discussion board posts, and the social-related discourse evident in their discussion board posts). We used this random forest model to address all three of our research questions.

To interpret our findings, we will  three main factors: (1) predictive accuracy of the random forest model, (2) variable importance, and (3) variance explained by the final random forest model. In this walkthrough, we will the R package **caret** to carry out the analyses.

## Load Packages



First, we will load the data. Our data is stored in the {dataedu} package that is part of this book. Within that package, the data is stored as an .rda file. We note that this data is augmented to have some other - and additional - variables that the `sci_mo_processed` data (used in [chapter 7](#c7) and [chapter 14](#c14) does not.

## Import and View Data


```r
#loading the data from the .rda file and storing it as an object named 'data'
data <- dataedu::sci_mo_with_text
```

It's a good practice to take a look at the data and make sure it looks the way you expect it to look. R is pretty smart, but sometimes we run into issues like column headers being read as datapoints. By using the `glimpse()` function from the {dplyr} package, we can quickly skim our data and see whether we have all the right variables and datapoints. Remember that the {dplyr} package loads automatically when we load the {tidyverse} library, so there is no need to call the {dplyr} package separately. Now, we'll glimpse the data.


```r

Scanning the data we glimpsed, we see that we have 662 observations and 111 variables. Many of these variables - everything below "WC" except the variable "n" -  are related to the text content of the discussion board posts. Our analysis here is not focused on the specifics of the discusion board posts, so we will select just a few variables from the LIWC analysis. If you're interested in learning more about analyzing text, the text analysis walkthrough in this volume will be a good place to start. 

As is the case with many datasets you'll work with in education contexts, there is lots of great information in this dataset - but we won't need all of it. Even if your dataset has many variables, for most analyses you will find that you are only interested in some of them. There are statistical reasons not to include twenty or more variables in a data analysis, and the quick explanation of the reason why is that at a certain point, adding more variables will *appear* to make your analysis more accurate, but will in fact obscure the truth from you. It's generally a good practice to select a few variables you are interested in and go from there. As we discussed above, the way to do this is to start with the research questions you are trying to answer. Since we are interested in data from one specific semester, we'll need to narrow down the data to make sure that we only include datapoints relevant to that semester.

Thus, we will *filter* the data to include only the data from one that semester, and then *select* variables of interest. For each step, we will save over the previous version of the "data" object so that our working environment doesn't get cluttered with each new version of the dataset. Keep in mind that the original data will stay intact, and that any changes we make to it within R will not overwrite that original data (unless we tell R to specifically save out a new file with exactly the same name as the original file). Changes we make within our working environment are all totally reversible. 

Below, we will *filter* to remove all the datapoints from the spring 2017 semester (indicated with a value of "S217" for the "semester" variable). We use the "!" to indicate that we want to keep all datapoints EXCEPT the datapoints that have a value of "S217" for the semester variable. Then, we will *select* only the variables we are interested in: motivation, time spent in the course, grade in the course, subject, enrollment information, positive and negative emotions, cognitive processing, and the number of discussion board posts.
