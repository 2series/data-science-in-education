## Background

These are some thoughts and ideas for a **collaborative book on data science (or data analysis) in education**. Thus, it touches on but is not focused on students themselves doing data science / data analysis, but rather on administrators, teachers, analysts, policymakers, and researchers doing data science / data analysis.

*Why a book on data science / data analysis in education using R?*

There are specific opportunities and challenges that make data science in education somewhat distinct from data science more generally:

* The structure and type of data:
    * hierarchical
    * often confidential
    * needs linking to other data sources
    * often not in CSV format
    
* The backgrounds of educational data scientists:
    * often used or use other software (more likely SPSS / SAS / Excel but also Python)
    * face organizational challenges to adopting of R
    * have been or are educators themselves 
    
* The approaches / methodologies used:
    * have to deal with messy data
    * multi-level models
    * text data
    * log-trace data
    * network models
    * time series data / longitudinal data
