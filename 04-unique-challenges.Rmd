# Unique challenges

Educational data science is a new domain. It presents opportunities, like those discussed in the [previous chapter](#03-ds-role.Rmd), but also challenges. We consider *the practice of educational data science* to include not only access, processing, and modeling data, but also social and cultural factors, like the training and support that educational data scientists have available to them. These challenges range from the very general (and common to *all* domains in which data science is carried out) to very particular to educational data science.

## Challenges common to doing data science in any domain 

One challenge for educational data scientists is common do data scientists in other domains: Combining content knowledge, programming, and statistics to solve problems is a fairly new idea. In particular, the amount of data now available means that programming is often not only helpful, but necessary, for stakeholders to use data in education.

## Lack of processes and procedures

Other challenges are more about the process and practice of doing educational data science. There are often no procedures in place for school districts to share data with each other in order to build context. Moreover, in academic and research settings, there are not often structures in place to facilitate the analysis of data and sharing of results
 
## Few guidelines from research and evaluation

While there is a body of past research on students' work with data (see Lee & Wilkerson, 2018, for a review), there is limited information from case- or design-based research and systematic evaluations on how others--teachers, administrators, and data scientists--work with data.

## Limited training and educational opportunities for educational data science

Educational data science is new. At the present time, there are limited opportunities for those working in education to build their capabilities in educational data science (though this is changing to an extent; see Anderson and colleagues' work to create an educational data science certificate program at the University of Oregon and Bakers' educational data mining Massive Open Online Course offered through Coursera). 

Many educational data scientists have been trained in fields other than statistics, business analytics, or research. Moreover, the training in terms of particular tools and approaches that educational data scientists are highly varied. 
    
## The complex and messy nature of educational data

Another challenge concerns the particular nature of educational data. Educational data are often hierarchical, in that data at multiple "levels" is collected. These levels include classrooms, schools, districts, states, and countries - quite the hierarchy! In addition to the hierarchical nature of educational data, by their nature, these data often require linking with other data, such as data that provides context at each of the aformentioned levels. For example, when data is collected on students at the school level, it is often important to know about the training of the teachers in the school; data at the district level needs to be interpreted in the context of the funding provided by the community in terms of per-pupil spending and other, for example. 

A final aspect concerns the *type* of data collected. Often, educational data is numeric, but just as often, it is not: It involves characteristics of students, teachers, and other individuals that are categorical; open-ended responses that are strings; or even recordings that consist of audio and video data. All of these present challenges to the educational data scientist. 
    
## Ethical and legal concerns

Related to the complex and messy nature of educational data is its confidental nature. At the K-12 level, most data requires protections because of its human subjects focus, particularly because the data is about a protected population, youth. 

Another issue concerns the aims of education. Those working in education often seek to improve it and often work to do so with a scarcity of school and community resources. 

## Analytic challenges

Due to the challenging nature of educational data, analyzing educational data is hard, too. The data is often not ready to be used: It may be in a format that is difficult to open without specialized software or it may need to be "cleaned" before it is usable. 

Closely related to the ethical and legal challenges, educational data scientists should be conscious of potential racial and gender biases in school models, and challenge not reinforce them. 

Because of the different *types* of data, the educational data scientist must often use a variety of analytic approaches, such as multi-level models, models for longitudinal data, or even models and analytic approaches for text data.
