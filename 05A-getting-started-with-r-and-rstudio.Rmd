# Getting Started with R and RStudio

## Chapter overview

This chapter is designed to take you from installing R and RStudio all the way through the basics of data loading and manipulation using the `tidyverse`. 
We will be covering the following topics in this chapter: 

- Installing R and RStudio
- RStudio environment and pane layout
- Basics of customizing your RStudio environment
- Introduction to help documentation
- Steps for working through new and unamiliar content
- Downloading and accessing the data sets used in this book

## Getting Started

First, you will need to download the latest versions of R and RStudio. 
R is a free environment for statistical computing and graphics using the programming language R. 
R Studio is a set of integrated tools that allows for a more user-friendly experience for using R.

Although you will likely use R Studio as your main console and editor, you must first install R as R Studio uses R behind-the-scenes. 
Both are freely-available, cross-platform, and open-source.

## Downloading R and RStudio

### To download R:

- Visit this page to download R: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- Find your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Download the 'latest release' on the page for your operating system and download and install the application

Don't worry; you will not mess anything up if you download (or even install!) the wrong file. 
Once you've installed both, you can get started.

### To download R Studio:

- Visit this page to download R studio: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- Under the column called "R Studio Desktop FREE", click Download
- Find your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Download the 'latest release' on the page for your operating system and download and install the application

If you do have issues, consider this [page](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/), and then reach out for help. 
One good place to start is the [R Studio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/).

## Navigating RStudio

## Check that it worked

Open R Studio. 
Find the console window and type in `2 + 2`. If what you can guess is returned (hint: it's what you expect!), then R Studio *and* R both work.

If you're completely new, Swirl is a great place to start, as it helps you to learn R *from within R Studio*.

And if you're ready to go, please proceed to the next sections on processing and preparing, plotting, loading, and modeling data and sharing results.

## Other Foundational Notes

### Configuring R Studio

There are a number of changes you *can* (but do not need to) make to configure R Studio. If you navigate to the Preferences menu in R Studio, you'll see a number of options you can change, from the appearance of the application to which windows appear where.

One important consideration is whether to save your workspace when you close R Studio. By default, R Studio saves all of the objects in your environment. This means that any data that you have loaded--or new data or objects that you have created, such as by merging two data sets together or creating a plot--will, by default, still exist when you open R Studio next. In general, this is not ideal, because it means that you may have taken steps interactively that are not documented your code. This means that when you share your code, or re-run it from the start, it may not work. An easy way to change this is to tell R Studio to start from scratch (in terms of your workspace) each time you open it. You can do that by changing the dropdown menu pointed out in the image below to "Never".

While this may seem like a dramatic step - never saving your workspace - it is the foundation for doing reproducible work and research using R Studio (and R). It also represents one of the biggest shifts from using software like Excel or SPSS, where most steps are not documented in code. This involves a shift from thinking that your most permanent and important part of an analysis is your data to thinking of the most important part as being the code: with the code, you can keep your data in its original form, process it, and then save a processed file, through running code. This also means that when you have to make a change to this code, you can re-run the entire analysis easily. 

### Getting Data In and Out

`clipr` is a package to easily copy data into and out of R using the clipboard. [add more]

`datapasta` is another option. [add more]
