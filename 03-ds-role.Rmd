What is a Data Scientist? 

One way to define data science is to think of it as [combining three skills](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) to do data analysis: programming, statistics, and content knowledge. Though if you Google "data science" you are sure to find lively debate about how to define it. 

Thinking of data science as a combination of these three services is useful in the context of this book because we simply substitute the field of education in for "content knowledge." But even then, that still leaves us with a broad field to imagine what a data scientist in education actually does on a day to day basis. 

Rather than grapple with defining the role of a data scientist in education—the discussions about what a data scientist is in general are still happening—it is more useful to share some examples of what data scientists do in the field of education. 

A data scientist in education doesn't need to be hired as a data scientist.
