What is a Data Scientist? 

One way to define data science is to think of it as [combining three skills](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) to do data analysis: programming, statistics, and content knowledge. Though if you Google "data science" you are sure to find lively debate about how to define it. 

Thinking of data science as a combination of these three services is useful in the context of this book because we simply substitute the field of education in for "content knowledge." But even then, that still leaves us with a broad field to imagine what a data scientist in education actually does on a day to day basis. 

While not having an established data scientist identity can make it hard for educators to explain their data work, it does have the benefit of allowing them to take on a variety of data-related work. Rather than grapple with defining the role of a data scientist in education—the discussions about what a data scientist is in general are still happening—it is more useful to share some examples of what data scientists do in the field of education. 

*Leading Office Culture Toward a Data-Driven Approach*

Jesse, a director at an education non-profit in Texas, is setting up a database to house student achievement data. This project requires a number of data science skills we'll discuss in chapter five, including cleaning data into a consistent format. Once the data is prepared, Jesse uses it to build dashboards.

But not all of Jesse's work can be found in a how-to for data scientists. She manages a team and serves as the de facto project manager for IT initiatives. And given her expertise and experience in data science, she's leading the charge towards a more data-driven approach within the organization.

*Helping Districts Meet Compliance Requirements*

Ryan, a special education administrator in California, uses data science to reproduce the state department of education's special education compliance metrics, then uses the results to build an early warning system for compliance based on local datasets. In this case, Ryan uses foundational data science skills like data cleaning, visualization, and modeling to help school districts be proactive with their compliance requirements. 

A data scientist in education doesn't need to be hired as a data scientist.
