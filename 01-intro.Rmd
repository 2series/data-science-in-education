It's hard to define what the challenges are for adopting data science in the educational setting. 

Having a clearer path for how to use data science in the education setting is possible. 

This book is an effort to define those challenges and offer some solutions. 

We aim to validate your role as an educator who is also a data scientist. 

We want to help develop clarity about how to use this role as a way to enhance the way you educate. 

We'd like to offer some practical examples showing the problems and solutions we've discussed. 

What is a Data Scientist? 

Conway's definition of data science helps to describe what a data scientist in education is good at. 

A data scientist in education doesn't need to be hired as a data scientist. 

This book is a conversation starter. We invite educators to contribute and help us bring even more definition and more solutions to the conversation. 

The story of data science in education might be similar to the story of data science in other fields.
