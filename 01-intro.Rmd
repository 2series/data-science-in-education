It's hard to define what the challenges are for adopting data science in the educational setting. 
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Data Scientists, Educators, and Data Scientists in Education: 

This book is a warm welcome and an invitation. If you're a data scientist in education or an educator in data science, we know that your role isn't exactly clear. We welcome everyone who wants to understand data science in education better. If you work in education or data science, you also own a part of the solution. We invite everyone to help define what it means to practice data science in education using their own experiences. 

We'll get to work on understanding data science in education soon, but first let's talk about why this relationship is not such a straightforward thing. 

Talking about data science in education is hard because everyone tackles it [on different levels](https://youtu.be/aQyXeLSL0II). If education were a building, it would be multi-storied with many rooms. There are privately and publicly funded schools. There are more than eighteen possible grade levels. You can be educated alone in front of a computer or with others in a classroom. 

This imaginary building also has rooms the residents never see: Business and finance staff plan for efficient use of limited funds. The transportation department plans bus routes across vast spaces. University administrators search for the best way to measure career readiness. 

Data science can help in these areas but we don't always see that because it's relatively new as a field. This means that our community is still trying to work out how it all fits in. It also means that folks in education aren't always used to having someone around [who understands education, knows how to code, and has can use statistical techniques](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram). 

So how do we create a role for a new field that can be applied across different levels of education and across different departments in education? 

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having a clearer path for how to use data science in the education setting is possible. 

This book is an effort to define those challenges and offer some solutions. 

We aim to validate your role as an educator who is also a data scientist. 

We want to help develop clarity about how to use this role as a way to enhance the way you educate. 

We'd like to offer some practical examples showing the problems and solutions we've discussed. 

What is a Data Scientist? 

Conway's definition of data science helps to describe what a data scientist in education is good at. 

A data scientist in education doesn't need to be hired as a data scientist. 

This book is a conversation starter. We invite educators to contribute and help us bring even more definition and more solutions to the conversation. 

The story of data science in education might be similar to the story of data science in other fields.
