# How to Use This Book 

It is really hard to draw clean boundaries around the topic of data science in 
education because people are educated in all kinds of settings and in all kinds 
of age groups. Education organizations also require different kinds of staff to 
make it work, which means different kinds of data science uses. A teacher's 
approach to learning from data is different from an administrator's or an 
opeartions manager. 

Since there are a lot of different readers, we believe there should be a lot 
of different ways to use the book, both as a reader and as a contributor.
