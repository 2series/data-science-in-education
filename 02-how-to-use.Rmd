We've heard it and experienced it many times--learning R, especially if R is your first programming language, is hard. Learning a program language is like learning a forein language. It's not just about learning new vocabulary words. It's also about learning new norms, underlying structure of the language, how sentences work, and the metaphors that hold the whole thing together. 

If you're not a brand new educator or consultant, you probably already have efficient solutions you use in your day-to-day work. We encourage you to make your learning meaningful and creative by applying what you learn from this book in your education job. But this means working through learning periods where you struggle through writing code or applying new statistics techniques for a problem that you could quickly solve with a tool your comfortable with, like your favorite spreadsheet software. One person we spoke with shared this story about their learning journey: 

>"The first six months were hard. I knew how quickly I could do a pivot table in Excel. It took longer in R because I had to go through the syntax and take the book out. I forced himself to do it though. In the long-term, I'd be a better data scientist. I'm so glad I thought that way, but it was hard the first few months."

We wrote this book for you because we do this work every day and know that there's some struggle that comes with the joy of using these techniques. We're not writing from the point of view of education data science masters. We're writing from the point of view of people who learned R and data science *after* we chose education. And like you, learning to use R and data science to improve the lives of students, is our daily practice. Join us in enjoying all of what comes with that--both the challenge of learning and the joy of solving problems in creative ways.

# How to Use This Book 

It is really hard to draw clean boundaries around the topic of data science in 
education because people are educated in all kinds of settings and in all kinds 
of age groups. Education organizations require different kinds of staff to 
make it work, which means different kinds of data science uses. A teacher's 
approach to learning from data is different from an administrator's or an 
operations manager.

We also know that very few get paid to learn how to bring data science and R to their education jobs. If we know education and data science, you're more likely an educator working with data and looking to expand your tools. You might even be an educator who **doesn't** work with data, but who's discovered a love for learning about the lives of students through data. Either way, learning data science and R is probalby not in your job description. 

You've got a full work schedule and challenging demands in the name of improving the student experience, and an office culture that doesn't allow for regular professional development time or self-driven learning. You also have a life outside of work, including family, hobbies, and relaxation. We struggle with this ourselves, so we've designed this book to be used in lots of different ways. The important part in learning this materials is to establish a routine that allows you to engage and practice the content every day, even if in small ways that only take a few minutes at a time. That will make the content ever present in your mind and will help you shift your mindset so you begin to see even more opportunities in your daily work that can be chances for practice. 

Since there are many different readers, we believe there should be 
different ways to use the book, both as a reader and as a contributor. Here are 
some ways to use this book:   

**Read the Book Cover to Cover and Try All the Walkthroughs**

We wrote this book assuming you are just starting your journey learning R and using data science in your education job. Writing it this way allowed for a reading experience that takes you from installing R to a chance to see and practice fairly advanced data science skills like text analysis. 

If you've never written a line of R code, we welcome you to the community! We wrote this book for you. Consider reading the book cover to cover and working through the analysis walkthroughs. Remember that you'll get more out of a few minutes of practice every day than you will from long hours of practice every once in awhile. Typing code into your console everyday, even if it doesn't always run properly, is a daily practice that invites learning and a-ha moments. We know how easy it is to avoid coding when it doesn't feel successful, so we've designed the book to deliver frequent small wins to keep the momentum going. But even then, we all inevitably hit a wall in our learning. When that happens, take a break and then come back and keep coding. When daily coding becomes a habit, so does the learning.  

If you get stuck in an advanced chapter and you need a break, try going back to an earlier chapter and reviewing. It's pleasantly surprising to see how much new learning we get from going back to old material with the benefit of new experience. That kind of back-to-basics attitude is sometimes what we need to get fresh perspective on new challenges. 

**Pick a Chapter That is Useful for Your Level of Experience and Start There** 

If you are a student or if you work in education, you may be trying to solve a 
very specific problem with data, like analyzing student quiz scores, projecting 
classroom sizes, or pitching a new data analysis method. In this case it might 
be useful to jump ahead to a chapter or section that discusses your area of 
interest. 

**Read Through the Walkthroughs and Run the Code**

If you are here to learn and practice coding in R, you can work through the 
example analyses. We wrote these based on typical data problems you might find 
as a student or staff in education, so it is worthwhile to copy or type the code, 
run it in your console, and change it to experiment with the results. 

**Contribute to the Book**

We quickly learned when planning the book that there are many ways to approach 
this topic and still we wanted to write in a way that is directly useful and 
practical for our readers in education. One way to meet this goal is to build 
procedures into the work for readers to directly contribute. We hope that as the 
book evolves it grows to reflect the observable needs of data scientists in 
education. Here are some ways readers can contribute: 

 - Submit a pull request to our 
 [GitHub site](https://github.com/jrosen48/data-science-in-education) that 
 describes a data science problem that is unique to the education setting 
 - Submit a pull request to share a solution for the problems discussed in the 
 book
 to the education setting
 - Share an anonymized dataset 
 
**A Note on Statistics**

It's been said that data science is the intersection between content expertise, programming, and statistics. We understand that as you grow your craft as a data science, you will be learning about statistical techniques like hypothesis testing and logistic regression. These three parts of data science compliment each other and when one is left out, it weakens your contribution considerably. A data scientist working in education who is an expert programmer and statistician but has not learned about the real life conditions in school that generate the data will make analysis decisions that ignore nuances. A data scientist who is an expert statistician and an education veteran won't be able to scale their analysis to have the largest possible influence on improving the student experience. A data scientist who is an expert programmer and an education veteran can only scale surface level analysis and will miss opportunities to draw causal relationships or predict outcomes in useful ways. 

Learning how statistics techniques work and how to use them responsibly and ethically is its own path and it's one that we take seriously. One education data scientist we spoke to while researching the book said this about the difference between building a model for an online retailer and building a model in education: 

>"It’s ok if I get shown 1000 brooms but if I got my model wrong and we close a school that will change someone else’s world." 

This book focuses on being your R reference as you start bringing data science tools into your education job. Our aim is to help you learn R by teaching it in two contexts: data science and workaday education datasets. We demonstrate statistics techniques like hypothesis testing and model building. These demonstrations teach you how to run statistics operations in R in a recognizable education context. The explanations stop short of a full discussion about the techniques themselves. 

We deliberately wrote within these boundaries because we felt strongly that the technical and ethical use of statistics techniques deserve their own space. We hope that you will take a satisfying leap forward in your learning by successfully using R to run the models and experiencing the model interpretations in our walkthroughs. We encourage you to explore other excellent books like **An Introduction to Statistical Learning** as you learn the required nuances of applying statistical techniques to scenarios outside our walkthroughs.
